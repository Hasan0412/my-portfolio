# Hasans React Portfolio

## Description

The React Portfolio task involves creating a dynamic single-page web application using React to showcase a web developer's work. The portfolio should include sections for About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume. It should feature a responsive design, intuitive navigation, and the ability to dynamically display projects, contact information, and a downloadable resume. The goal is to provide employers and peers with an interactive and visually appealing platform to assess the developer's skills and work samples. Furthermore, this React Portfolio task emphasizes the use of modern technologies and best practices in web development. It requires the deployment of the portfolio to GitHub Pages and encourages developers to consider mobile-first design, choose an appealing color scheme, and ensure a polished user interface.

## Installation

In the terminal, you have to first type the command 'npm i'. This command installs the required packages mentioned in the 'package.json' file. After the required packages are all downloaded, type the command 'npm run start' to get the React App running.
